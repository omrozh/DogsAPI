## How to use the API

- Run get-db management command.

- Unless you want to download all the images again do not change the redownload_images parameter to true while calling the getBreeds function.

- Make a get request to /dogs/view_all_breeds/ to view all dog breeds and the respective number of images.

- Make a get request to /dogs/view_breed/&lt;breedname&gt;/ with the breed name of your choice to view the urls for images of the breed.

- Make a get request to one of the paths you see at /dogs/view_breed/&lt;breedname&gt;/ to view the image.
